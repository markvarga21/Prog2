Main idea:
- pixel art style platformer like game with extras
- jatek vegen nagy boss
- egy adott szamu akadaly(ok) utan lada, amit egy kis boss oriz (w multiple states)
- multiple weapon, melee and ranged too
- inventory with healing options and other potions (speed, power etc.); switch bar on the bottom, and also player-health bar
- idle, run, attack, switch, jump etc. animations
- health bars both for the player and the bosses
- sound effects
- UI menu (controls - WASD / ARROWS -, resolution, difficulty etc.), maybe w blur while paused
- spawn points and respawn on them
- merchants in certain points (maybe with default dialogues.. near spawn points where the player can buy certain tools/potions etc. for money (displayed in the top right corner)
- multiple levels and maybe the boss is at the end of these levels
- multiple language option in the options tab
- optimal performance with a low-end computer too
- triggers (!)
- background having a cool parallax effect, infinitely looping, but may differ on other maps
- visual particle effects in jump, die, etc.
